# My Personal Website: www.matt-gallant.com
Made in part for CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. Please see requirements for this project [here](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/0/project0.html).

The website I built for Project 0 is a personal profile website. I have included information about myself, both personal and academic, relevant skills and projects, and left room for future expansion with the "Exercise Stats" page. This site serves as a draft of a site I would want to show future employers to demonstrate my skills and portfolio. I plan to make it better suited to different screen sizes in the future and make the overlook better once I get more comfortable with CSS and Bootstrap. I have used HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootstrap in this current version of the site.

### Pages
Here's a bit about some of the pages:
 - **about.html**: Has some more personal info about me as a person and a few pictures of myself.
 - **index.html**: Landing page of the site. Short description of myself and the site, navbar at top.
 - **skills.html**: The real bulk of the content right now. Displays all of my relevant skills, projects and courses.
 - **contact.html**: Lists some of the ways to contact me and connect with me via social media.
 - **exercise.html**: A page that currently does nothing. I eventually hope to do something cool with my exercise stats and display it here. Waiting to learn about backend to practice this.

### Styling Files
I worked with 2 different CSS files. **theme.css** is the styling used for the entire website. It defines the color pallet, all of the navigation styling and much of the inidivudal html styling. To create **theme.css** I used SASS, working entirely in the **theme.scss** file. The only other css file is **contact.css**, I used this to style the social media icons. I probably could have broke up these files in a little more organized fashion, but thought it was okay given the relatively low complexity and size of my current site.
